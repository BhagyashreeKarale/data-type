# Type Conversion Question 1
# This is an exercise.
# You can answer each question by uploading a file.

# Remember python files have .py extension.

# For your sake, we have broken this question into several parts. But you have to submit in a single file.

# Part 1
# 1.Store a STRING value in var12. 2.Then typecast the STRING value to FLOAT and store in var13.
var12="bhagyashree"
var13=float(var12)

# Part 2
# 1.Store a FLOAT value in var23. 2.Then typecast the FLOAT value to INTEGER and store in var24.
var23=17.0
var24=int(var23)

# Part 3
# 1.Store an INTEGER value in var34. 2.Then typecast the INTEGER value to STRING and store in var35.
var34=17
var35=str(var34)
# Part 4
# 1.Store a FLOAT value in var45. 2.Then typecast the FLOAT value to STRING and store in var46.
var45=4.5
var46=str(var45)
# Part 5
# 1.Store a STRING value in var56. 2.Then typecast the STRING value to INTEGER and store in var57.
var56="aarti"
var57=int(var56)
# Upload the code of all the parts of this question by writing it in a single python file.
